### PSQL database acces from Python scipt
## Psycopg2 
Used __Psycopg2__ library to create connection to my own sql database and perform some operations on it.
Project uses also __Tkinter__ as GUI for simple feedback. More specified informations are still on IDE console.
The main goal for this project was to create a stable connection to database and be able to perform queries and some light changes with it and commit those actions live.
Project was targeted to be a database for my recipes with brief informations about them.

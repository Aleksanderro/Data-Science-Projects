# Python - my beloved
## Machine Learning
Started my adventure with __Machine Learning__ on uni. I was in charge of part of my engineering paper about creating an inteligent model of electric car motor which autoselects its control methods based on changing environment.
Next moves within ML were about changing job branch into __IT - Data Science__ strictly. I made some research and started learning Python by myself with __Tensorflow__.
## SQL
Next step in this journey was learning some relativity database and management systems. Decided to start with __PostgreSQL__ and really liked it.
For now I implemented some sql into Python with __Psycopg2__ and it is awesome.
## Tkinter as GUI
Beside data science I am used to searching tidiness in chaos that i am creating sometimes with my visions about projects. It helps very much with clear sight about what is the real goal with actual project.
## openness - C++/C
During my uni the first programming language was C++ and I am still connected to it as my another hobby is __Arduino__. As another hobby I am creating some Arduino projects to implement it in some kind of __smart home__.

# Handwritten digits recognition
My first bigger Python/ML project. I was excited how these kind of advanced systems can be created by using so few lines of simple code. Unbelievable.

# Psql handling in Python
After getting into SQL I really wanted to combine python with sql in one project. For now I managed to create working script which can connect to sql database and perform some operations on it.

# Future plans
1. First think I'd like to learn is some cloud-computing which unlock PC resources and allows to perform huge operations on data. Currently I consider __AWS__ or __Azure__ to learn.
2. Next thing is some __linear regression__. In HDR project I used __MNIST__ and __Sklearn__ so for linear regression I consider using __Keras__ probably.
3. Improving actual projects is my go-to thing when I will be getting better in Python and ML.
